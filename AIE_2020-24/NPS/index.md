## **Abstract**:

Our research on program synthesis focuses on automating the generation of computer programs from specifications, holding the potential to streamline software development and improve code quality. In this project we aim to perform text-to-code generation, partial code completion, and program generation from input-output examples. Finally we aim to train the model dynamically on data from online platforms such as Codeforcse, Codechef and Hackerrank for optimal code generation.
