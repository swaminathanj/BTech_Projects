## **Abstract**:
This study investigates the use of genetic programming for automated code correction, concentrating on fixing Python syntax mistakes. Using the evolutionary programming paradigm, programmes that can automatically fix inconsistent code are evolved. An initial population of genetic programmes is created, subjected to genetic operators, and their fitness is evaluated by having them correct given code snippets. The suggested approach consists of defining an appropriate primitive set, building a toolbox to control genetic operations, and developing a fitness function to assess the accuracy of evolved programmes. The research dataset comprises a diverse collection of Python code snippets featuring syntax errors alongside their corrected counterparts. This dataset guarantees the genetic programming model’s resilience over a range of fault kinds and complexity, making it essential for both training and assessing the model. Selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness assessment are all included in the evolutionary process, which entails recurrent generations of changing programmes. The goal of the study is to provide thorough analysis and results that assess how well the genetic programming model fixes code by taking metrics like convergence speed and correctness into account. This strategy has the potential to greatly advance automated code repair techniques and improve software development processes’ effectiveness.
